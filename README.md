## Core
It is my education/passion project of 2D game engine using c++ and SDL2 library.

### Core's working functionalities are:
- Loading and managing image files (textures) and fonts
- Spawning objects
- Managing objects and cleaning after them
- Typical methods like: Update, OnSpawn, OnDestroy...
- Detecting collisions based on range of 2 objects (circle around the center)
- Rendering based on sorted drawcall system 
- Camera (rect that defines rendered region)
- Culling objects out of render area
- Timed tasks (tasks runing delegate functions after specified time)
- Different types of input methods (continuous, single, repeatable)
- Animating sprites
- Parenting
- Components
- DebugDrawing

### Features i still want to work on:
- Scenes (collections of objects with their metadata)
- Collisions:
  - box colliders
  - collision system optimizations
- Serialization
- UI system
- ...
